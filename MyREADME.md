# Technologies

* Arch Linux - System
* Netbeans - IDE
* Zsh - Bash for git

## Concepts

* Gitflow - Git usage logic.
* Semantic versioning -  For version number. I kept 1.0.0 because it was the initial proposal the features created.
* Maven - To dependence control
* Junit - To unit tests.

In the source code explanatory comments on the development logic were inserted. To follow the line of reasoning you can follow the git branch tree.
